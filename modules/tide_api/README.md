# INTRODUCTION
The Tide API module provides the content API functionality and related
configurations. This module is required in case you want to use your site in a
headless manner.

## Redirects
This module introduces a wildcard redirect feature. Redirects using the
Redirects module can be added with a `%` at the end in order to create wildcard
redirects. E.g. `/my-path%` will match `/my-path-title`,
`my-path/sub-folder/path` and `/my-path-other-title`.

# Caveats

Tide API is on the alpha release, use with caution. APIs are likely to change
before the stable version, that there will be breaking changes and that we're
not supporting it for external production sites at the moment.
